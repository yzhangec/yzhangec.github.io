Exploration with mobile manipulator has received increasing attention from both academia and industry. In many existing works, spaces occluded by objects are typically considered inaccessible. However, for real-world applications like search and rescue, it is crucial to investigate these occluded spaces by interacting with the environments. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware exploration framework to thoroughly explore cluttered environments containing obstructed spaces with an eye-in-hand mobile manipulator robot. We introduce a new representation called hidden frontier, which can efficiently guide robot to discover occluded unknown space by active interaction. Moreover, a constrained whole-body configuration database is designed to quickly query and output the feasible whole-body configurations given a desired sensor pose during exploration planning. After that, a global path planning is formulated as an Asymmetric Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (AGTSP) to solve for a minimum-time viewpoints visitation sequence. Simulation experiment results show that proposed method is capable of efficiently exploring the environments more thoroughly and producing voxel maps with higher coverage through active interactions.
